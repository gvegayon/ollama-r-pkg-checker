# Getting started with Ollama in Python
George G Vega Yon
2025-10-01

This document shows how we can use the `ollama` Python package to
interact with Ollama models. To run this, it is assumed that you have
the ollama server up and running on your local machine (you started
`ollama serve` in your terminal), and that you have installed the
`ollama` Python package.

You can learn more about ollama and the Python package in the [official
documentation](https://ollama.com/docs).

## Building the chat as a model

One nice feature of the ollama interface is that we can pass the entire
conversation history to the model to use it as context. This is done by
passing the previous messages as a list of dictionaries to the
`messages` argument of the `client.chat()` method.

The following function, `tell_me_about_r()` is a simple example using
the `client.chat()` method to have a conversation with the model about R
programming. The function makes three calls to the `client.chat()`
method, each time passing the previous messages as context. We will use
this as a way to compare the performance of two different models:
`deepseek-r1:1.5b` and `tinyllama:1.1b` (both lightweight and easy to
run on CPUs).

To ensure reproducibility, we set the `seed` option to a fixed value. We
also set the `temperature` option to 0 to make the modelâ€™s responses
more deterministic.

``` python
import ollama

def tell_me_about_r(
    model: str,
    options: dict = { "seed": 124, "temperature": 0 }
    ) -> None:

    # Function to print the output
    def print_response(response: dict, query: str) -> None:
        print(f'\n{"-" * 80}\n[Model: {model}] Response time: {response["total_duration"] / 1e9} seconds\n{"-" * 80}')
        print(f'Response to the query:\n{query}\n{"-" * 80}')
        print(response['message']['content'])
        return None

    # Starting the client
    client = ollama.Client()

    # First response
    response = client.chat(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            {'role': 'user', 'content': "Can you tell me about R programming?",}
        ],
        think=False, # gemma3 doesn't support think
        options=options
    )

    # Printing response 1
    print_response(response, "Can you tell me about R programming?")

    # Second response
    response2 = client.chat(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            *[response['message']],
            {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the main differences it has with C++? I am thinking of language features that would typically be standard in one and not the other',}
        ],
        think=False,
        options=options
    )

    # Printing response 2
    print_response(response2, 'What are the main differences it has with C++? I am thinking of language features that would typically be standard in one and not the other')

    # Third response
    response3 = client.chat(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            *[response['message']],
            *[response2['message']],
            {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Summarize our conversation so far in a few sentences.',}
        ],
        think=False,
        options=options
    )

    # Printing response 3
    print_response(response3, "Summarize our conversation so far in a few sentences.")

    return None
```

    Certainly! Here's an overview of R Programming:

    ### **R Programming**
    R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data scientists for developing statistical software and data analysis.

    #### Key Features:
    1. **Statistical Analysis**: R provides a wide range of statistical techniques, including linear regression, ANOVA, classification, clustering, etc.
    2. **Data Visualization**: R has powerful tools for creating high-quality graphs and visualizations, such as ggplot2, plotly, and base R graphics.
    3. **Extensive Package Ecosystem**: R has a vast collection of packages available through CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) that extend its functionality to almost any other domain.
    4. **Open Source**: R is an open-source language, which allows for community contributions and transparency in software development.

    #### Syntax:
    - Basic syntax includes variables, functions, control structures, loops, and conditional statements.
    - Example code:
      ```r
      x <- c(1, 2, 3)
      mean_x <- mean(x)
      print(mean_x)
      ```

    #### Data Structures:
    - Vectors: One-dimensional arrays (e.g., numeric, character).
    - Matrices: Two-dimensional arrays.
    - Data Frames: Two-dimensional tables with mixed data types.
    - Lists: Collections of different types of objects.

    #### Syntax for Control Flow:
    ```r
    x <- c(1, 2, 3)
    y <- c(4, 5, 6)

    # Vector addition
    z <- x + y
    print(z)  # Output: [1] 5 7 9

    # Vector multiplication
    w <- x * y
    print(w)  # Output: [1] 4 10 18

    # Dot product
    dot_product <- sum(x*y)
    print(dot_product)  # Output: 20

    # Conditional statements
    if (x > y) {
      print("x is greater than y")
    } else {
      print("x is less than or equal to y")
    }
    ```

    #### Data Handling:
    - Importing data: Using functions like read.csv(), read.table(), etc.
    - Subsetting and manipulating data: Using [ ], subset(), merge(), etc.

    #### Example Workflow:
    1. **Import Data**: `data <- read.csv("data.csv")`
    2. **Transform Data**: `data$age <- as.numeric(data$age)` (converting a character column to numeric)
    3. **Visualize Data**: `ggplot(data, aes(x=age, y=score)) + geom_point()` 
    4. **Analyze Data**: Use statistical functions or packages for modeling.

    #### Example Analysis:
    - Linear regression: `model <- lm(score ~ age, data = data)` and then use summary(model) to get results.
    - Visualization: After plotting the data, add a regression line using abline(model$coefficients).

    ### Conclusion:
    R is a powerful language for statistical analysis, data visualization, and programming. Its extensive ecosystem and community support make it a preferred tool among data scientists and statisticians.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    R is primarily a statistical programming language, while C++ is a general-purpose programming language used for system software development, embedded systems, and high-performance computing. Here's an overview of their main differences:

    ### 1. **Language Scope**
    - **R**: Focuses on data analysis, statistics, and graphical models.
    - **C++**: Targets low-level operations (like memory manipulation), system programming, and embedded systems.

    ### 2. **Data Types**
    - **R**: Supports numeric types (integer, double, etc.), factors, strings, and logical values.
    - **C++**: Uses primitives like int, char, float, double, bool, long, short, and long long. It also supports union types for mixed-type operations.

    ### 3. **Control Structures**
    - **R**: Offers if-else statements, loops (for, while), and break/continue.
    - **C++**: Provides if-else, switch-case, do-while loops, and for-each with break. Exception handling is done via try-catch blocks.

    ### 4. **Functions**
    - **R**: Supports functions like return, list(), function() syntax.
    - **C++**: Uses std::function for function definitions, but it's less common in C++ code compared to other languages.

    ### 5. **Classes and Objects**
    - **R**: Does not support object-oriented programming (OOP) directly; objects are created using S3/S4 classes.
    - **C++**: Supports OOP with classes defined using class, base class, derived class syntax.

    ### 6. **Error Handling**
    - **R**: Uses try-catch blocks for error handling.
    - **C++**: Also uses try-catch but is less common in C++ code compared to other languages like Java or Python.

    - **R**: Does not support multi-threading natively; it's limited to single-threaded execution.
    - **C++**: Supports multithreading using threading, mutex, and semaphores.

    ### 8. **Memory Management**
    - **R**: Uses pointers for dynamic memory allocation (e.g., new()).
    - **C++**: Manages memory through manual memory management functions like malloc(), free(), and free2(). It also supports garbage collection.

    ### 9. **Portability**
    - **R**: Runs on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux.
    - **C++**: Is platform-specific but can be compiled for different architectures (e.g., x86, ARM).

    ### 10. **Community and Ecosystem**
    - **R**: Highly active community with extensive packages and tooling.
    - **C++**: Has a smaller active community compared to R, though it's widely used in enterprise environments.

    ### Conclusion:
    While C++ is excellent for system programming and embedded systems, R excels in data analysis, statistics, and graphical modeling. The choice between them depends on the specific needs of the project or application.
